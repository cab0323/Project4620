# Project4620
This project was created while taking a class on databases. It uses java to connect to a database set up on AWS.
It craetes a pizza ordering system for a fictional restaurant. It lets the pizzeria add an order to the system, 
connect that order to a customer, and give a discount, among other things one would be able to do when ordering a
pizza. Currently the database on AWS is no longer available as it was only availabe while having access to the class.
